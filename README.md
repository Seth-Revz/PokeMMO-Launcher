    <p>The launcher assumes your PokeMMO installation is at `~\AppData\Local\Programs\PokeMMO` by default. If yours is not in this location use the folder icon to select your PokeMMO folder. <b>Newish PokeMMO install location is in Program Files. </b><sub>Will add this to the launcher in the future sometime</sub></p>
    <p>To add an account, click add and select the savedcredentials.properties file. Then give it a name in the next prompt.</p>
    <p>To add another account, sign out of the current account in PokeMMO and into the new one, repeat the above.</p>
    <p>GEC is to launch <a href="https://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/137452-tool-gilans-encounter-counter-beta-available-v102-update/">Gilans Encounter Counter</a> along with PokeMMO. If you dont know what that is or dont use it, ignore this button.
